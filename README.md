#Titan Control Panel Plugin - NextGen Plugin for Visual Studio 2010+

It is an extension for Visual Studio providing a set of useful toolwindows, refactoring methods,
debugging-time visualizers and special data insertion/edition inside current code windows.
It will reduce your coding effort in number of places today!

This repository contains ported version of my [TytanNET Add-in plugin](https://tytannet.codeplex.com/)
as a Visual Studio package and support its newer editions.

##Contribution
Sorry, but for now I will reject all code contributions. Feel free to fire a bug or feature request.
